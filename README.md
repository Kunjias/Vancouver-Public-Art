# Vancouver-Public-Art
Analysis of City of Vancouver's Public Art Installation using data from the City of Vancouver Open Data Catalogue.
Vancouver is a city with rich cultural histories and diversities, and there is no better way than Public Art appreciation to explore those cultures and this city.
We found a data set on Vancouver's Public Art statistics. By analyzing this data set, we'd like to take a deeper look into the Public Art in Vancouver. 
Based on the analysis, we would like to predict the possible future development of the city's art and cultural infrustructures.
